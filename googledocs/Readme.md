### Low-Level Design Problem Statement: Google Docs

#### **Objective**
Design a simplified version of Google Docs, a collaborative online document editor where multiple users can create, edit, and save text documents in real-time. Focus on the **low-level design** of the system, adhering to object-oriented design principles and considering scalability for multiple concurrent users.

### **Requirements**

#### **Functional Requirements**  
1. **Document Management**:  
   - Users can create, open, edit, and delete documents.  
   - Each document should have a unique ID, title, and content.  

2. **Real-Time Collaboration**:  
   - Multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously.  
   - Changes made by one user should be visible to other users in real-time.  

3. **Versioning**:  
   - Maintain a history of changes for a document to enable undo/redo functionality.  

4. **User Management**:  
   - Users must be able to log in, log out, and manage their profiles.  
   - Access control to documents (e.g., read-only, editor).  

5. **Offline Editing**:  
   - Users should be able to edit documents offline, with changes synced back when they reconnect to the internet.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements**  
1. **Concurrency**: Support concurrent editing of the same document by multiple users.  
2. **Data Persistence**: Ensure that document changes are saved reliably.  
3. **Scalability**: Support thousands of users and documents simultaneously.  
4. **Performance**: Real-time updates should propagate within milliseconds.  
5. **Extensibility**: The system should be modular enough to add features like spell-check, comments, or images in the future.

### **Guidelines for Design**
1. Use **object-oriented design principles** such as SOLID and design patterns.  
2. Ensure separation of concerns between different modules (e.g., document storage, collaboration).  
3. Address potential bottlenecks, such as handling conflicts in real-time editing.  
4. Provide an **API contract** for key functionalities like editing and syncing.  
5. Demonstrate the use of **data structures** for managing document content, version history, and collaborative editing.

### **Strengths**
1. **Use of Design Patterns**:
   - **Memento Pattern**: The use of the `DocMemento` class for versioning and saving/restoring document states is apt for handling undo/redo functionality.
   - **Observer Pattern**: The `listeners` in the `Document` class and the `notify` method implement a basic observer mechanism, keeping users updated with real-time changes.

2. **Concurrency Management**:
   - The `ReentrantLock` in the `Line` class ensures thread-safe updates to individual lines, preventing race conditions.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Using a `Map<Integer, Line>` in the `Document` class allows efficient access and modification of specific lines, which is crucial for scalability in large documents.

4. **Extensibility**:
   - The design is modular, with well-defined responsibilities for classes like `Document`, `Line`, `DocUser`, and `VersionManager`, making it easier to add features like collaborative editing or comments.

5. **Unique ID Generation**:
   - The `DocUniqueNumberGenerator` is a simple yet effective way to ensure unique document IDs.

6. **Exception Handling**:
   - Custom exception (`LineNotFoundException`) adds clarity and robustness to the design.

### **Areas for Improvement**
1. **Real-Time Collaboration**:
   - The current design notifies listeners when a line is updated, but there's no mechanism for resolving **edit conflicts** in real-time when multiple users edit the same line simultaneously.
   - Consider implementing a **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDT)** or **Operational Transformation (OT)** to handle collaborative editing effectively.

2. **Immutable Snapshots in Memento**:
   - In `DocMemento`, the `Map<Integer, Line>` reference is shallow-copied. Since `Line` objects are mutable, changes to lines after creating a memento will reflect in previously saved states.
   - Consider deep-copying the `Line` objects to ensure true immutability of saved states.

3. **Code Structure and Redundancy**:
   - The `Line` class has redundant `setLineEntry` and `update` methods. Consolidating these into a single method could simplify the logic.
   - The `userInputs` method in `Line` is hardcoded for demo purposes. It would be better to decouple this functionality and take input dynamically (e.g., from the `DocUser`).

4. **Listener Update Logic**:
   - The `notify` method in `Document` calls `update` for all listeners except the current user. While this works for a simple notification system, it doesn’t account for:
     - Synchronization of other users' views of the document.
     - Efficient broadcasting mechanisms in large-scale systems.

5. **Error Handling for Lock Contention**:
   - When a `ConcurrentModificationException` is thrown, there’s no mechanism to retry or queue the edit. Consider a retry strategy or queueing system to improve the user experience.

6. **Scalability Concerns with VersionManager**:
   - The `VersionManager` stores all versions in memory (`List<DocMemento>`), which could lead to high memory consumption for large documents or frequent edits. Consider persisting versions to a database or file system.

7. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - The `Main` class demonstrates basic functionality but doesn’t cover edge cases, such as:
     - Simultaneous edits on the same line.
     - Large document handling.
     - Undo/redo boundary conditions.

### **Suggestions for Enhancement**
1. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Introduce a mechanism like **last-writer-wins**, CRDT, or OT to resolve conflicts when multiple users edit the same line simultaneously.

2. **Optimized Notification System**:
   - Use **websockets** or a **publish/subscribe model** for real-time notifications to users.

3. **Persistent Storage**:
   - Save document states and versions to a database (e.g., MongoDB for document-oriented storage or Redis for in-memory storage).

4. **Improved Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Add detailed logging for changes to the document and for concurrency-related events to debug real-time editing issues.

5. **Dynamic Scalability**:
   - Divide the document into sections and use a distributed lock mechanism (e.g., ZooKeeper) to allow concurrent editing on different sections.

### **Overall Assessment**
Your implementation is solid and captures the essence of a collaborative editing system. It shows a good balance of OO principles and practical coding, with a focus on modularity and extensibility. By addressing the identified improvements, your LLD could evolve into a more robust and production-grade design.
