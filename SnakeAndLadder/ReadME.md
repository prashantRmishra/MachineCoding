### Snake and Ladder app in java

### Problem Statement !(https://workat.tech/machine-coding/practice/snake-and-ladder-problem-zgtac9lxwntg)

## This application takes in inputs
    

    ```
    number of snakes, their head and tail positions
    number of ladders, their start and end positions
    number of players, their names
    ```

### Starting position of players will be 0 ( off the board of size 100)

### Features of the App:
    1. Generates the random dice value between 1 to 6
    2. Checks all the rules of snake and ladder
    3. Intuitive CLI outputs


Code written is modularized to the best of my abilities

Different classes for ``Snake``, ``Ladder``, ``Player`` has been created
A class ``SnakeAndLadderUtil.java`` has been created that handles all the tasks related to snake and ladder game.

``Main.java`` class is responsible for getting the input from the cli and calling the ``play()`` method of the ``SnakeAndLadderUtil.java`` class.

For output reference refer to the file ``sampleOutput.txt``
