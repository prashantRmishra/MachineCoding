The Parking Lot machine coding question is a popular problem used in interviews to test a candidate's understanding of object-oriented design principles, data structures, and basic problem-solving skills. Here’s the typical problem statement:

Problem Statement
Design and implement a system to manage parking in a parking lot. The system should support the following functionalities:
Requirements
	1	Parking Lot Design:
	◦	The parking lot can have multiple levels.
	◦	Each level can have a fixed number of parking spots.
	2	Vehicle Types:
	◦	There are different types of vehicles: motorcycle, car, and truck.
	◦	Parking spots should accommodate vehicles based on their size:
	▪	Motorcycle spots: For motorcycles only.
	▪	Compact spots: For motorcycles and cars.
	▪	Large spots: For motorcycles, cars, and trucks.
	3	Parking Spot Assignment:
	◦	Assign the nearest available spot to a vehicle based on its size.
	◦	The system should handle adding, removing, and tracking vehicles in the lot.
	4	Features to Implement:
	◦	Park a vehicle.
	◦	Remove a parked vehicle.
	◦	Display the status of the parking lot.
	◦	Check availability of parking spaces.
Constraints
	•	The solution should be object-oriented and modular.
	•	Optimize for extensibility, e.g., adding new vehicle types or spot types.
	•	Use only in-memory storage; no databases.

Bonus Features
	1	Allow reservations for parking spots.
	2	Implement pricing based on parking duration.
	3	Add support for electric vehicle charging stations.
